## Description

This application uses Node.js and Express.js to create Note Taker page that allows the user to write and save notes. The user can also view the notes in read-only mode and delete obsolete data. The application uses an Express.js back-end to save and retrieve its note data from a JSON file.

My objectives for this application is based on the following user story and acceptance criteria;

### User Story

```
As A small business owner
I want to be able to write and save notes
So that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

```

### Acceptance Criteria

Then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.

When I click on the link to the notes page
Then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.

When I enter a new note title and the note's text
Then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.

When I click on the Save icon
Then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
